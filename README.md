# Basketball-Stats-Tool---Project-2
A program that shows basketball teams and their players listed.
Will create a start menu to choose an option to either display the team stats or quit.
When they choose the option to show team stats, you will be able to choose from 3 different teams.
the stats will list the total number of players on the team you select, divided evenly between experienced players and inexperienced players.
stats will also display the average height of the player, list the names of the players and their respective guardians.
Once a team is listed it will then prompt to continue and return to the menu to be able to choose the options over again.
